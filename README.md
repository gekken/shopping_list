# ShoppingList

This is a simple gem that creates shopping lists with an intentionally simple API.

At this time, ShoppingList intentionally uses the standard *nix Dropbox(tm) installation location. ~/Dropbox/


v1 will be a shoes application, with Windows compatibility
v2 will be built in JRuby for Android use.
v3 will be a Rails site that integrates the Android app, a desktop client, and the site.

## Requirements

working Dropbox installation at ~/Dropbox

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'shoppinglist'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shoppinglist

## Usage

currently, this gem is simply an API.
